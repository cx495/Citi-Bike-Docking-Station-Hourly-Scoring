# CITIBIKE DOCKING STATION SCORING

Citibike has a Bike Angel program where they incentivize people to rebalance their bikes. 
They use scores to encourage users to rebalance the bikes so they could reduce cost on rebalacing bikes using trucks.
Currently there is a set of scores for the morning then another for the evening commute.
I developed a new methodology for scoring each of the stations, a more dynamic scoring function as a hourly scoring.
