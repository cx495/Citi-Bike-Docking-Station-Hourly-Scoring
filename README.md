# CITIBIKE DOCKING STATION SCORING

Citi Bike has a Bike Angel program where they incentivize people to rebalance their bikes. <br>They use scores to encourage users to rebalance the bikes so they could reduce the cost on rebalancing bikes using trucks.<br> Currently there is a set of scores for the morning then another for the evening commute. <br>I developed a new methodology for scoring each of the stations, a more dynamic scoring function as an hourly scoring.
